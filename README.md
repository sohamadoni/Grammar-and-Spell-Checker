Grammar and Spell Checker with Advanced Features
This Python code provides a comprehensive grammar and spell checker that goes beyond basic typo detection. It leverages spaCy for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and integrates other libraries to offer advanced functionalities.

Features:

Spell Checking: Identifies and corrects spelling errors using LanguageTool.
Verb Tense Correction: Fixes errors in verb tenses, like using the present tense instead of the past participle.
Preposition Correction: Addresses incorrect verb-preposition-noun combinations.
Sentence Structure Correction: Identifies and potentially corrects broader sentence structure issues using fuzzy string matching.
Error Reporting: Provides detailed reports on identified errors, including types and counts.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
spaCy (en_core_web_sm or larger model recommended)
LanguageTool Python library
sympound (for fuzzy string matching)
NumPy (for loading pre-computed dictionaries)
Getting Started:

Install required libraries (pip install spacy languagetool sympound numpy).
Download spaCy's English language model (python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm or larger model).
Place the pre-computed dictionary files (correctly.npy and sentence_correction_dict.npy) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script (python grammar_checker.py - replace with your script name).
Provide the text you want to check for errors.
